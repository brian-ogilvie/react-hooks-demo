# React Hooks Demo

A brief demonstration of React Hooks beyond useState.

## Getting Started

This repo contains a few examples to explore some of the hooks (and other React APIs) for optimizing performance of your React app. We'll cover:

- memo
- useMemo
- useCallback
- useDeferredValue

### How to install this demo

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Fire up the app using `npm start`.
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the output.

### Completed vs Starter Code

The `master` branch contains the completed code with all the optimizations we'll discuss. To see the starter code and view its results in the browser, check out the `starter-code` branch:

```
git checkout starter-code
```

## Demo 1: Memoization

With the `starter-code` branch checked out, open [src/demos/MemoDemo.js](./src/demos/MemoDemo.js)

Forgive the contrived example, but here we have a parent component that renders a simple click counter. When the user clicks the button, the count increases. It also renders a child component, which we'll imagine to have a very expensive render. Maybe it's a map component that has to hit an external API and then do some expensive drawing.

In reality, all this child component does is render the components we pass it via the `coords` prop and invoke an `onRender` callback that also comes via props to let us know every time it renders. If you take a look at the app in your browser with your JS console open, you can see that the child component is rendering every time you click the button to update the count. (Actually, it's rendering twice due to StrictMode in a dev environment. [Here's why.](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/StrictMode#fixing-bugs-found-by-double-rendering-in-development)) This is no big deal in our example, but if the child component was actually a very slow, expensive render, this would be a big performance hit, and for what? The child component actually doesn't care about the value of the click count. It only renders coordinates and invokes a callback, so there's no reason for it to have to re-render. But in React, when a parent component re-renders, by default its entire sub-tree also re-renders.

### Memoization to the rescue!

React offers a few ways to memoize the results of running functions, saving the result, to avoid needing to run those functions again. `React.memo` allows you to memoize an entire component, so that it only needs to be re-rendered if its props change. To use it, simply wrap your component definition in a call to `memo()`:

```
import {memo} from 'react';

const SlowComponent = memo((props) => {...});
```

If you try wrapping `SlowComponent` in `MemoDemo.js` in a call to `memo()`, and head back over to the browser. When you click no the button you'll see... it's not working. The component is still rendering every time. Why?

This has to do with how "equality" really works in JavaScript. In evaluating whether the props have changed, React checks not whether they are equal in content, but whether they are truly the same, as in, the same locations in memory. If your props are primitive values like strings, numbers, or booleans, there's no issue, but look at our `coords` prop. That's an object. Every time the parent component renders, that object is re-declared and saved in a new memory location. It's not truly the same object even thought it's equal to the previous one, so React has no choice but to re-render the child component. How do we fix this?

`React.useMemo` allows you to memoize, not a whole component, but a value within a component. Typically we'd use it to avoid having to run an expensive calculation again, but we can also use it to stabilize the definition of a value for referential equality. `useMemo` takes two arguments:

1. A function to invoke which generates the value
2. An array of dependencies, e.g. values that could change causing us to need to run the function again.

In our toy-code example, `coords` doesn't even have any dependencies. We just want to return the same object every time no matter what. Let's apply `useMemo` to stabilize our `coords` prop:

```
import {useMemo} from 'react';

const coords = useMemo(() => ({
  x: 100,
  y: 200,
}), []);
```

Now if we go back to the browser... it's still not working. As it turns out, we still haven't stabilized all our props. The function `onRender` is also getting a brand new definition every time the parent component renders (In JS, functions are objects). Unfortunately, `useMemo` won't help us here because it's meant to memoize a **value**, the result of having called a function. But we need to memoize the **definition of a function**.

That's what `useCallback` is for. Its signature is the same as `useMemo`, taking two arguments:

1. The function you want to memoize
2. An array of dependencies, e.g. values our function depends on which, if changed, would cause us to need to redefine the function.

Again, in our example, our simple callback doesn't depend on any external values, so the dependency array will be empty:

```
import {useCallback} from 'react';

const onRender = useCallback(() => {
  // do the thing
}, []);
```

Now head back to the browser, maybe clear the JS console, and start clicking the button. Look! The child component only renders initally, and then not again as the count state is updated.

<div style="background-color:skyblue;color:black;padding:8px;margin-bottom:18px"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Should you use memoization for every component and value you have? Absolutely not! Memoization comes at a cost: the space it takes to store previous results in memory. React renders are generally pretty fast, so only reach for memoization when you're sure performance needs to improve.</div>

<div style="background-color:skyblue;color:black;padding:8px;margin-bottom:18px"><strong>ALSO NOTE:</strong> I'm aware that a better choice regarding our <code>coords</code> object would have been to pass the primative values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as props instead of the object, eliminating the need for memoization. But I need to come up with examples somehow.</div>

## Demo 2: Deferring a Value

With the `starter-code` branch checked out, open [src/demos/DeferredValueDemo.js](./src/demos/DeferredValueDemo.js)

In this example, we have a parent component that renders two text fields `name` and `query`. The value from the `query` field is passed into a child component which ostensibly needs to do a very expensive re-render, maybe data visualization or word art: use your imagination. For this example, I've manually made the child component slow to render using a `wait` function. Essentially, it puts us into an infinite `while` loop for the duration specified before completing its rerender. This will help us actually feel the pain until we fix the problem.

So let's head to the browser, click on the "Deferred Value" tab, and type your name into the first text field.

Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyikes! The UI is totally locked. Your typing doesn't even show up in the field for several seconds until the slow component has a chance to finish rendering and the parent component can catch up. This is an awful user experience. How can we fix this?

First, looking at the code, you'll notice that the child component doesn't even rely on the value of `name`. Why are we re-rendering the slow component when `name` changes? That's an easy fix with our old friend `React.memo`. If we wrap our `SlowComponent` definition in a call to `memo`, you'll see that right away, you're able to interact with the `name` field and the UI interactivity is nice and snappy again. Awesome!

But if you type into the `query` field, we still have the same problem. The child component is re-rendering, taking 0.5 seconds for each re-render, on **every keystroke**, locking the UI in the meantime. This is brutal.

Presumably, there's no way to avoid the fact that re-rendering the results of a new search query is going to be painful, but we shouldn't need to do that for every key stroke. The user can't even see what they're typing, and we don't need to update the component until they finish entering somethin anyway. This is a great use case for `useDeferredValue`.

### What's `useDeferredValue`?

According to the docs:

> `useDeferredValue` is a React Hook that lets you defer updating a part of the UI.

Some excerpts about what it's really doing:

- During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so the returned value will match the old value), and then try another re-render in background with the new value (so the returned value will match the updated value).
- Only when the background render is complete, will it be revealed in the UI, replacing the previous render.
- There is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value.
- **However**, any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.

The last point is huge. Whereas before, we had to do the full re-render for every single keystroke from the user, now we can completely abandon a background re-render if new input (additional keystrokes) come from the user. That means, we can wait for it... **defer** doing the expensive re-render and blocking the UI until after the user has finished typing.

The API for `useDeferredValue` is simple, just pass it the value you want to defer. Note that this should only be used for primative values, like strings, or objects that are defined outside of the rendering process:

```
import {useState, useDeferredValue} from 'react';

const [value, setValue] = useState(<some primative value>);
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```

All we need to do is add a call to `useDeferredValue` and pass it our `query` variable. Then we'll pass the deferred version of `query` to our slow component rather than the original version:

```
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

...
<SlowComponent query={deferredQuery} />
```

If you head back to the browser, we can see that this has dramatically improved the interactivity of the UI. When we type, we can see the changes, and we don't have to wait to see the results until after we've finished. But there's still a bit of an improvement we could make in the user experience.

### Showing stale values while waiting for a deferred render

With a little CSS, we can indicate to the user that the UI they're seeing is stale and in the process of being updated. All we need to do is compare the value of `query` with `deferredQuery`. If they are different, let the user know that something's going on. Say, lower the opacity of the component that's waiting to render:

```
<div style={query !== deferredQuery ? {opacity: .5} : {}}>
  <SlowComponen query={deferredQuery} />
</div>
```

Check it out in the browser. Way nicer!

So good work! We've used a number of React features to improve the performance of our UI and give our users a better experience.

### A thought from Kent C. Dodds on preventing re-renders:

> Let's say that you have to punch yourself in the face every time you blink. Maybe you'd think: "oh gee, I guess I'd better not blink as much!" You know what I say? I say you should stop punching yourself in the face every time you blink! So instead of just reducing how often a bad thing happens (slow renders), maybe you could eliminate the bad thing and feel free to blink (render) as much as your eyes need you to.

In other words, before you reach for any of the tools we've discussed today--which help prevent unecessary re-renders--make sure you've done everything you can to make each render as efficient as possible. Clean up each component first, then worry about optimizing the number of renders. You can read Kent's full article on the subject here: [Fix the slow render before you fix the re-render](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-slow-render-before-you-fix-the-re-render).
